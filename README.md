# Tableau Dashboards - Cumulative Lab

## Introduction
Over the course of the Tableau module, we have used the Superstore Sales dataset learn about the Tableau environment interface, including the Start page, Data Source page, and Workspace. Then, we explored the useful visualizations that can be created in Tableau Public. Finally, we discussed how we can combine the vizzes in our workbooks to create dashboards to communicate our insights.  Now it's your turn to apply your skills in Tableau.

In this exercise, you will use knowledge of the Tableau interface, data visualizations, and dashboards to re-create the dashboard pictured below. To simplify the process, we have labeled each section of the dashboard with a number.

Follow the prompts for each numbered section to recreate the dashboard.

</td></tr></table>
    </center>

When you are finished, save and publish to Tableau Public. Then, add the link to this assignment and click submit. You've just created your first interactive dashboard with Tableau Public!
